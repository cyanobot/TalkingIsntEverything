    <description>This mod aims to make an inability to talk less crippling. A number toggleable options are provided to control what mute pawns can and can't do.\n\nA pawn is "mute" if they are incapable of Talking (Talking 0% in the Health tab), whether that's due a genetic inability, injury, or any other reason. (Mute is not the same as Incapable of Social work.)\n\nFeatures:\n- New and adjusted log entries : The log will no longer describe mute pawns responding verbally to chit-chat, telling stories to babies, etc, etc.\n- (Toggleable) Animal interactions : Talking is no longer required to tame or train animals.\n- (Toggleable) Romance : Mute pawns can initiate romance and propose marriage instead of waiting for their partner to do so.\n- (Toggleable) Casual interactions : Allows mute pawns to maintain (or destroy) their social relationships using the same mechanics as any other pawn, but with new non-verbal log entries.\n- (Toggleable) Slavery: Allows mute pawns to enslave prisoners and suppress slaves, using new non-verbal log entries.\n\nMute pawns remain incapable of:\n- Giving speeches\n- Recruiting prisoners\n- Converting anyone to their ideoligion\n- Using "Word of" psycasts\n- Using the comms console\n- probably more\n\nThey also still have a very low Social Impact and Negotiation ability.</description>
